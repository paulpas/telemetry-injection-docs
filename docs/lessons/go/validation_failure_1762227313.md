# Validation Failure Analysis

## Date: 2025-11-03 21:35:13

## Pattern: The Go compiler is unable to locate the specified file during compilation.

## Root Cause:
The error indicates that during instrumentation, a file named 'telemetry_utils.go' was referenced but not found in the project directory. This suggests an incorrect path or missing file was specified for inclusion in the build process.

## Suggested Fix:
Verify that the file 'telemetry_utils.go' exists in the correct directory. Ensure that the path specified in the instrumentation code matches the actual location of the file. If the file is supposed to be generated by another part of the build process, ensure that this step completes successfully before attempting to compile.

## Prevention:
- Specifying non-existent files or incorrect paths in instrumentation code.
- Assuming that all necessary files are already included without verifying their presence.

## Full Error:
```
stat telemetry_utils.go: no such file or directory

```
